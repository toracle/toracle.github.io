## The Cluetrain Manifesto

95 theses for the people of earth-the Web site that started it all.

### Introduction ([view](http://www.cluetrain.com/book/introduction.html))

#### 1. Internet Apocalypso - Christopher Locke ([view](http://www.cluetrain.com/book/apocalypso.html))

Ancient markets were full of the sound of life: conversation. They dealt in craft goods that bore the marks of the people who made them. Then mass production led to mass marketing and mass media: interchangeable workers, products, and consumers, along with the hiearchical bureaucracies needed to command and control them. But the Internet--unmanaged and full of the sound of the human voice--is proving that the Industrial Age is nothing but an interruption as the conversations resume, this time on a global scale.

#### 2. The Longing - David Weinberger ([view](http://www.cluetrain.com/book/longing.html))

Our culture has greeted the Web with such enthusiasm, even before we've understood what exactly it's for, because we believe it's returning something we miss deeply; our voices. We are now ending the Faustian bargain according to which we gave up much of our individuality at work in return for the illusion of living in a manageable, safe world. As we emerge into the new understanding, it is being revealed that this cultural change is in fact spiritual.

#### 3. Talk is Cheap - Rick Levine ([view](http://www.cluetrain.com/book/talk.html))

Voice--the authentic expression of the individual present in the craftwork of our hands as well as in our words--is in resurgence on the Internet. In fact, the Internet is a conversation carried on in a variety of formats--Web pages, e-mail, discussion groups, mailing lists--that bring new possibilities to human relations. Business-as-usual isn't happy about this, because conversation are unpredictable, messy, and uncontrollable. But there's no silencing our human voices. Wise companies will learn how to enter the conversation.

#### 4. Market are Conversations - Doc Searls and David Weinberger ([view](http://www.cluetrain.com/book/markets.html))

The mass production of the industrial let companies to engage in mass marketing, delivering "messages" to undifferentiated hords who didn't want to receive them. Now the Web is enabling the market to converse again, as people tell one another the truth about products and companies and their own desires--learning faster than business. Companies have to figure out how to enter this global conversation rather than relying on the old marketing techniques of public relations, marketing communications, advertising, and other forms of propaganda. We, the market, don't want message at all, we want to speak with your business in a human voice.

#### 5. The Hyperlinked Organization - David Weinberger ([view](http://www.cluetrain.com/book/hyperorg.html))

Like their counterparts in the marketplace, intranetworked emplyees are learning to speak in their own voice, ignoring the org charts, and telling the truth to one anohter--and to their customers. The direct connection, worker to worker, enabled by intranets is undermining the old management pyramid, turning the walls of Fort Business into conversations. Fromthe bottom up, businesses are beginning to accept openness, decentralization, fallibility, messy context-rich information, stories, and the sound of the authentic voices of individuals.

#### 6. Ez Answers - Christopher Locke and David Weinberger ([view](http://www.cluetrain.com/book/ez-answers.html))

We're living through a change of historic propretions, so there are no easy answers. In fact, there aren't even any easy questions any more. The on most commonly asked--in magazine articles and political speeches--are disguised attempts to distract us from the truly deep changes that are occurring. We'd do far better to learn to listen to the questions coming from our hearts.

#### 7. Post-Apocalypso - Christopher Locke ([view](http://www.cluetrain.com/book/post-toasties.html))

The only revolution that matters is already well underway (and by the way, we're winning). A strange and oddly playful attitude is in evidence nearly everywhere online, an ironic shared intelligence that subverts the core assumptions of traditional institutions. There's fun afoot on the Internet, and business had better take it seriously. When paradox becomes paradigm, it's already too late to look for a magic bullet cure for Corporate Liguistic Deficit Disorder. It's time to imagine entirely new roles, new reasons, new worlds.
