Norm Kerth의 Project Retrospectives 1장 정리

## Preface

> but sometimes he feels that there really is another way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment and think of it.

> If we would only take a moment to stop and think of alternative ways to proceed, I'm sure we could find better ways to do our work.

> The reason for this is that a well-run retrospective can help members of a community understand the need for improvement, and motivate them to change how they go about their work. The community designs the changes, since it knows best how to identify, organize, and give priority to the problems to be solved. Owning the changes helps the community become the master of its software process.

## Chapter 1. Introduction to Retrospectives


> "(Humans,) They hope that even if they do things that didn't succeed before, that by doing them the same way twice, they will get different results."

> Owl is wise, but the pigs do not share his wisdom - the learning that comes from experience. Without this type of learning, most creatures are in danger of reliving earlier experiences - landing back in the swamp time after time.

경험은 중요한 학습의 재료이다. 하지만 잠시 멈춰서서 그것을 숙고해보지 않는다면, 재료가 저절로 숙성되지는 않는다.


> Instead, they believe that what worked so well in one situation is the perfect technology to use in all their engineering efforts, whether they are building a house or an ark.

> The pigs, like so many of us in the software engineering field, are missing the bigger picture.

> I call this The Law of Wisdom Acquisition: 'It is much easier to identify another's foolishness than to recognize one's own'

> This law suggests that it is not natural for us to stop, reflect, and learn from our software projects.

> The act of reflecting on my just-finished project is not naturally a high priority.

회고하는 것은 자연스럽게 되지 않는다. 다른 할 일도 많기 때문에 우선순위가 밀린다. 때문에 일종의 '의식'으로 미리 정해놓는 것이 좋다.


### The Need for Ritual

> It should involve everyone associated with the project. One person can not know the whole story of the project; one individual's reflection can only bring about small-picture learning.

> This big-picture wisdom comes from our ability to understand the relationship between an individual's work and that of the entire team. We need to tell our piece and see how it helps make up the whole story.


### Prime Directive for a Retrospective

> For a retrospective to be effective and successful, it needs to be safe. By "safe," I mean that the participants must feel secure within their community - to discuss their work, to admit that there may have been better ways to perform the work, and to learn from the retrospective exercise itself. Safety must be developed and maintained.

> Part of being safe means knowing that there will be no retribution for being honest (such as being given a negative evaluation during the next performance review). Trust must be established and maintained during a retrospective.

반드시 회고 이전에는 사람들이 회고 공간을 안전하게 느끼도록 관리해야 한다. 그래야 사람들이 솔직해지고, 회고를 통해 배울 수 있다.

> A method for expressing "unsafe" ideas during the retrospective needs to be established. To begin building safety and trust, the facilitator must communicate the prime directive for all retrospective rituals: KerthPrimeDirective

> Regardless of what we discover, we must understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job he or she could, given what was known at the time, his or her skills and abilities, the resources availables, and the situation at hand.


### The Darker Side of Retrospectives

> Complaint energy is tricky to handle. The message in the complaint is worth listening to, but the packaging of the complaint can harm the learning process.

사람들은 비난에 익숙하다. 또한 한 번 비난의 분위기가 형성되면, 정직하게 자신을 돌아보고 그 분위기를 깨닫고 빠져나오는 사람도 적다. 안전하지 않은 상태에서 진행된 회고는, 상어떼에 물어뜯기는 상황이 된다.
