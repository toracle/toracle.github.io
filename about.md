A medium inspired Jekyll blog theme. The basic idea came from the Ghost theme 
[Readium 2.0](http://www.svenread.com/readium-ghost-theme/). I use mediator on my own blog [The Base](blog.base68.com).

You can **download** the theme here:

You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)
