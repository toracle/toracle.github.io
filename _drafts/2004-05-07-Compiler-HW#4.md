1. Implement the algorithm for contextual analysis (type and scope checking) in the Mini-Triangle parser (download this) using the visitor design pattern as suggested in the text book. 

2. Try to check your program using some mini triangle programs including some contextual errors in them.

Your program should accept the mini triangle program as a command argument:

ex) checker xxx.tri
