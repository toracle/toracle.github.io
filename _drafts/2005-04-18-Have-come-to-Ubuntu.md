To use Solaris 10 sould be paid - basically it is free of charge, but to get technical supports which even include patches and upgrades a user should pay $120 per year as a minimum - , and there's some problems - suddenly desktop setting were broken - I decided to migrate OS to new one. First I think of debian/linux, but for looking KLDP bbs I found Ubuntu.

Ubuntu is a release project of debian, which promotes humanity of desktop system. As they said, during installation I need not to do many thinks, just input some configurations likes new account name/password, hostname, that's all. Time spends by installation is only one hour!

And now I'm on Ubuntu desktop but I've found there isn't a hangul IM so I'm writing in English.

It is based on GNOME desktop, environments are well-formed and even beautiful.
Now on, I'd configure hangul IM and some other softwares.
